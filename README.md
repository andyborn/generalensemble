A music sharing website built in Rails

This was my first rails project as part of the General Assembly WDI developer course.

The project was completed over 5 days during week 5 of the course.

The website is designed to facilitate sharing of music by artists and discovery of new music by fans.

Artists are able to upload songs, images and to a small extent customise the look of their artist page by changing the header image and
font colour.

Fans are able to explore artists by genre tags and to comment on songs.

Comments are flaggable by users for inappropriate content.

There is a built in admin component accessible only through an admin defined account.  This allows full management of the site data.

Site has not been hosted yet.

Site currently uses Sqlite database.
